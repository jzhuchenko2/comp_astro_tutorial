Introduction
============

This is a collection of notebooks on computational (astro)physics,
delivered for an undergraduate tutorial in Spring 2021.

The goal for the semester is to work our way up to understanding how to
do computational hydrodynamics using grid (finite-volume) techniques.

The notebooks start with the basics that will be needed to understand
how to work with discretized data and represent derivatives in space
and integration in time.
