# the Euler Equations

The Euler equations describe compressible flow in the absence of
dissipative effects (like viscosity).  In one-dimension, they appear
as:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\rho u^2 + p) &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left [ (\rho E + p) u \right ] &= 0
\end{align*}

Here, $E$ is the specific total energy which is related to the specific internal energy as:

$$
\rho E = \rho e + \frac{1}{2} u^2
$$
